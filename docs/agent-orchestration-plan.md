# Agent orchestration on avada — gap analysis & design

How to run an LLM **agent org** on top of avada: a manager driving worker panes, or a
recursive **CEO → manager → workers** tree. This builds on the control API (M2/M2b — see
[`cli-multiwindow-mcp-plan.md`](cli-multiwindow-mcp-plan.md)) and the separate MCP project at
`C:\avada-mcp`.

**Status (2026-06-05): Phases A, B & C ALL BUILT & static-verified** across both repos
(avada typecheck + 141 unit tests + `electron-vite build`; MCP typecheck + 64 unit tests +
`tsc` build, all green).
- **Phase A** — pane-id env (A), activity (B), meta (C), `open_pane`→paneId (D).
- **Phase B** — message bus (E: durable inbox, `/panes/:id/messages`, scope-filtered `message`
  events, `send_message`/`read_messages`/`send_to_parent`/`broadcast_subtree` + a subscribable
  messages resource), capability scoping (F: `POST /tokens`, scope enforced on every route, a
  scope-filtered `/state` + event stream, scoped-token-via-env that suppresses the master
  control file), and `whoami`.
- **Phase C** — clean output (G: `?strip=1`), advisory write lock (H: `POST/DELETE
  /panes/:id/lock` gating `send_input`).

**Live socket round-trip — SMOKE-VERIFIED 2026-06-05** (first time over a real socket).
Driven against the packaged build (`Avada.exe` v0.1.2; control on loopback;
`control-settings.json = {enabled:true, allowInput:true}`) with the MCP bridge running *inside*
a pane — so `whoami` self-identification was exercised with **real injected env, not a
simulation** (it correctly reported its own paneId from `AVADA_PANE_ID`). All three layers
(raw HTTP/WS · MCP tools · orchestration) passed, and all five prior-flagged risk predictions
were confirmed:
- **D · `open_pane`→paneId (fix #2):** the `/command` round-trip returns the new paneId both raw
  (`{ok, result}`) and via MCP `open_pane` (a real id, never `undefined`).
- **B · activity (fix #1):** `activity` frames fire on `/events` in BOTH directions (busy↔idle),
  per-pane, on the flip (idle threshold = `idleAlertSeconds`, default 10s); the flip reaches
  `list_panes`. The bridge→client `resources/list_changed` notification is the only async hop
  not observable from a tool-call harness; its functional effect (refetch shows new activity)
  holds.
- **F · scoping:** a scoped token's `/state` is filtered to its subtree (1 pane vs 8),
  out-of-scope command → 403, escalation mint → 403, narrower sub-mint → ok, and a scoped
  `/events` stream received ZERO sibling frames (no leak).
- **Scoped-token env suppression:** a child spawned with `AVADA_CONTROL_TOKEN` in env gets
  `PANE_ID` + `CONTROL_TOKEN` + `CONTROL_PORT` but NOT `AVADA_CONTROL_FILE` — it cannot
  read the master token. Scoping is meaningful end-to-end.
- **E · messaging:** durable inbox, monotonic `seq`, cursor reads (`after=`) return only newer.
- **G · strip / H · lock:** `?strip=1` returns clean text; an advisory lock refuses a non-owner
  `send_input` ("locked by <owner>"), allows the owner, releases on unlock.

**One real bug found (live-only — units didn't catch it) — FIXED 2026-06-05:** `set_meta`'s
read-back echo was **racy**. The bridge re-read `/state` immediately after the `setMeta` command,
which raced the renderer's *debounced* control-publish, so the echo returned the **pre-merge**
snapshot (missing the just-set keys) — the merge itself was correct (the keys appeared in `/state`
a few hundred ms later). This violated fix #7's "echo the TRUE merged meta" promise under normal
timing. **Fix (mirrors `newPane` → id, D/fix #2):** `applyControlCommand`'s `case 'setMeta'` now
returns the merged meta straight from the store as the command result; MCP `set_meta` echoes
`res.result` instead of re-reading `/state` (also drops an HTTP round-trip). Regression tests
added on the app side (`control.test.ts`: merged-keys echo, `{}` on full-clear, `undefined` for a
missing pane). The user-facing tool description is unchanged (it still returns the TRUE merged meta).

Minor live findings — both FIXED 2026-06-05:
- `/state` didn't surface `subtitle` though `rename_pane` reports it. **Fix:** `subtitle` added to
  `ControlPaneInfo`/`buildControlPayload` (app) and `ControlPane`/`list_panes` (MCP), omitted when
  unset; test added.
- `send_input` with a bare `\n` did **not** submit on cmd.exe/conpty (needs `\r`). **Fix:** the
  control-server input handler normalizes newlines to CR on Windows via `submitNewlines`
  (`control-input.ts`, pure + unit-tested), so `\n` now submits on both platforms; the tool doc's
  "append \n/\r" is accurate again.

Still open (by-design heuristic, already under Risks): **spawning a pane re-tiles the layout,
resizing every pty → repaint output → all idle siblings briefly read `busy` for ~10s** — a
manager watching `activity` right after spawning a worker can be transiently misled.

**Fixes verified on the LOCAL build 2026-06-05** (isolated `electron out/main/index.js
--user-data-dir=…` alongside the packaged app; fresh local MCP `dist`). `set_meta` now returns
the TRUE merged meta **synchronously** as the `setMeta` command `result` (raw `/command` and
through the rebuilt MCP `set_meta`, incl. `null`-delete) — no `/state`-re-read race; `/state` +
`list_panes` surface `subtitle`; a bare `\n` submits on cmd.exe (newline normalized to CR). Also
ran a **real Claude agent in a pane** wired to the local MCP: it `whoami`'d its own paneId,
`read_messages` from its inbox, and `send_to_parent` a structured report that landed in the
parent's inbox — the full manager↔worker loop on local code. (The agent's `-p` TUI restored the
alternate screen on exit, wiping the pane scrollback — a textbook case of why the structured
message bus beats output scraping.)

**Design decisions taken during the B/C build** (the plan's open questions, resolved):
- *Message delivery* → **durable per-pane inbox, at-least-once, monotonic-seq cursor reads +
  live push nudge** (a late/reconnecting node still reads its backlog). Bounded per pane.
- *Scoped-token security* → a child is handed `AVADA_CONTROL_TOKEN`/`_PORT` via pane env,
  and that **suppresses the `AVADA_CONTROL_FILE` injection**, so a scoped worker can never
  read the master token from `control.json`. Scoped tokens are in-memory, optionally TTL'd, and
  may only mint *narrower* sub-tokens (no escalation), validated against the live tree.
- *Dumb workers* keep the `send_input`/`read_pane` fallback; the message bus + scoping are for
  MCP-capable nodes. Inbox/lock state for a closed pane lingers until app restart (bounded).

## Hard requirement: topology flexibility

The design must serve **both** shapes without favoring either, and must allow mixing them:

- **(A) Single external orchestrator** — one LLM (e.g. Claude Code holding the MCP) drives N
  worker panes. No worker manages anyone.
- **(B) Recursive agent-managers** — a manager is *itself* an agent running in a pane, which
  spawns and drives its own sub-workers; nest arbitrarily (CEO → managers → workers).

Consequences that shape every primitive below:

1. **Hierarchy is data, not API.** The org chart lives in per-pane metadata + the natural
   window→tab→pane tree, never hard-coded into endpoints. A flat manager→workers and a deep
   CEO→…→worker use the *same* primitives.
2. **Every node is addressable and self-aware.** A pane-agent must know *who it is* and *how
   to reach the control plane*, or (B) is impossible.
3. **Access is capability-scoped but defaults to full.** The root holds the master token (no
   scope); a parent may mint a *narrower* token for a child. (A) just uses the master token;
   (B) hands each manager a subtree-scoped token. Scoping is opt-in, never required.
4. **Two node kinds, two comms paths.** An **MCP-capable** node (a real agent CLI with the
   avada MCP configured) talks structured messages over the control plane. A **dumb**
   process (no MCP) is driven by `send_input` and observed by reading its output. The design
   supports both; structured beats scraping wherever available.

## The model

- **Pane = worker.** Each is a terminal running an agent CLI (or a plain command).
- **Org tree = window → tab → pane.** `GET /state` already returns `windowId / tabId /
  tabTitle / activeTab`, so grouping (division/team/worker) is readable for free.
- **Control plane = the loopback control API.** Multiple clients may connect (token-gated
  HTTP + `/events` WS), which is what makes (B) possible at all.

## The additions

Grouped; each notes which side it touches — **app** = `C:\avada` control plane,
**MCP** = `C:\avada-mcp` tool surface.

### A. Pane self-awareness — the recursion enabler *(app)*
On spawn, inject env into the pane's pty (`src/main/session.ts` builds `env`; `session:spawn`
in `ipc.ts`):
- `AVADA_PANE_ID` — the pane's own id.
- `AVADA_CONTROL_FILE` — path to the discovery file (or, when scoping is on, a
  pre-minted **scoped token** so the child can only touch its subtree).
An MCP-capable agent launched in that pane then auto-knows its identity and how to reach the
control plane — without which a manager-in-a-pane can't act. A `whoami` MCP tool returns
`{ paneId, role, parent, scope }` from env + `/state`.

### B. Liveness / activity *(app)*
Surface the **already-built** idle detector (`src/renderer/store/useIdle.ts`, the idle-glow
quiescence heuristic) into the control plane:
- Add `activity: 'busy' | 'idle' | 'exited'` to `ControlPaneInfo` (publish from
  `buildControlPayload` in `control.ts`).
- Emit an `{ type:'activity', paneId, activity }` frame on `/events` when it flips.
- **Heuristic, document it as such:** "idle" = no output for N seconds (the agent is likely
  waiting at its prompt / done). Not a contract that work is complete. This is the single
  highest-leverage add for orchestration — it's how a manager knows a worker is ready for the
  next instruction without scraping.

### C. Structured pane metadata *(app + MCP)*
Add `meta?: Record<string, string>` to `PaneSpec` (workspace JSON + `open_pane`) and to the
live pane + `ControlPaneInfo`. Reserved keys give the org its shape:
- `role` (e.g. `ceo` / `manager:frontend` / `worker`), `parent` (parent paneId),
  `agentType` (`claude` / `aider` / …), `task` (current assignment) — rest free-form.
A `set_meta(paneId, meta)` command + `meta` on `open_pane` make the org **self-describing for
any reader**, which is what lets the same API serve (A) and (B).

### D. `open_pane` returns the new paneId *(app + MCP)*
Today `/command` is fire-and-forget (`{ ok }`); `applyControlCommand`'s `newPane` calls
`addPane` which *does* return the id, but it's dropped. Add a command result round-trip:
attach a `correlationId` to dispatched commands, have the renderer reply
`control:commandResult { correlationId, result }`, and resolve the `/command` HTTP response
with it. Lets a manager spawn workers concurrently and map each to its id (no racy
list-diff).

### E. Message bus — structured inter-node comms *(app + MCP)*
The neutral transport that replaces scraping for MCP-capable nodes. Per-pane inbox:
- `POST /panes/:id/messages { from, body }` — enqueue.
- Delivery: for an MCP-capable target, push `{ type:'message', to, from, body }` on its
  `/events` stream and expose `read_messages` / `send_message` MCP tools. For a **dumb**
  worker, the orchestrator falls back to `send_input` (inject) + `read_pane` (observe).
- Hierarchy helpers built on `meta`: `send_to_parent`, `broadcast_subtree` resolve targets
  from `parent`/tree — but the bus itself is hierarchy-agnostic (any pane → any pane), so it
  serves both topologies. **Open question:** delivery semantics (at-least-once? ack? cursor
  vs push) — see Risks.

### F. Capability scoping *(app + MCP)*
Opt-in, so (A) ignores it and (B) relies on it:
- `POST /tokens { scope: { windowIds?|tabIds?|paneIds? }, ttl? }` → a scoped token. The
  server tags every token with its scope and enforces it on all routes (read, command,
  input, messages). Master token (in `control.json`) = unscoped = the root/CEO.
- A parent mints a child token covering the child's subtree + its own inbox and passes it via
  env (A). A worker thus *cannot* close the CEO's pane.

### G. Clean output mode *(app + MCP)*
`GET /panes/:id/output?tail=N&strip=1` → ANSI-stripped text, for a manager parsing a worker's
TUI. Cheap. (Structured messaging is the real answer; this is for observability / dumb
workers.)

### H. Concurrency *(app)*
Advisory `POST /panes/:id/lock` to serialize `send_input` when multiple managers might write
the same pane. Low priority; until then document "one writer per pane."

## How it composes (proof of flexibility)

- **(A) single orchestrator:** master token; `list_panes` + `meta.role` to see the org;
  `open_pane(meta)` to staff it; `activity` event to know when a worker is ready;
  `send_input`/`read_pane` (or messages, if workers are MCP-capable). Scoping/whoami unused.
- **(B) recursive org:** launch the tree from workspace JSON (windows=divisions,
  tabs=teams, panes=agents, `meta` = roles/parents). Each manager-pane boots MCP-capable,
  reads `AVADA_PANE_ID` + its scoped token (`whoami`), spawns sub-workers within scope,
  and coordinates over the message bus (`send_to_parent` / `broadcast_subtree`). Same
  primitives, more levels.
- **Mixed:** a manager may drive some MCP-capable sub-managers (messages) and some dumb
  command workers (`send_input`) side by side. Nothing in the API forbids it.

## Phased plan

- **Phase A — cheap, high-impact (unblocks solid single-orchestrator + makes the org
  self-describing):** B (activity), C (meta), D (open_pane→id), and the env half of A
  (`AVADA_PANE_ID`). All small; the activity detector already exists.
  **BUILT & static-verified 2026-06-05** (both repos green; live socket smoke still pending —
  see the status note at the top).
- **Phase B — recursion & coordination:** E (message bus), F (scoping + scoped-token env), the
  `whoami` tool. **BUILT & static-verified 2026-06-05** — messaging-semantics decision recorded
  in the status note above (durable, at-least-once, cursor-based).
- **Phase C — polish:** G (clean output), H (locking), hierarchy convenience tools
  (`send_to_parent`/`broadcast_subtree`). **BUILT & static-verified 2026-06-05.**

## Implementation — Phase A (file-level)

The cheap bundle: **pane-id env (A)**, **activity (B)**, **meta (C)**, **open_pane→id (D)**.
Keep the MCP (`C:\avada-mcp`) in lockstep — its zod is `.strict()`, so any new
`PaneSpec`/`ControlPaneInfo` field must be added there too or it rejects valid input. Gate
each change with `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build` on both repos.

### A1 — `AVADA_PANE_ID` env *(small)*
- `src/renderer/components/Terminal.tsx` (~L362): add `paneId` to the `window.hp.spawn({…})`
  call (the `paneId` prop is in scope).
- `src/preload/index.ts` `SpawnOptions` + `src/renderer/global.d.ts` `HpSpawnOptions`: add
  `paneId?: string`.
- `src/main/session.ts`: `SpawnOptions` add `paneId?`; in the env block add
  `if (opts.paneId) env.AVADA_PANE_ID = opts.paneId;` and
  `env.AVADA_CONTROL_FILE = join(app.getPath('userData'),'control.json')` (path always;
  may not exist until control is enabled — the agent checks). Scoped token is Phase B.

### B — activity (busy/idle/exited) *(medium)*
- **Decouple tracking from the glow:** in `src/renderer/store/useIdle.ts`, drop the
  `if (!s.idleAlert) return` early-out in `markActivity` so idle is tracked regardless of the
  visual setting; verify `PaneFrame.tsx` (L83 area) still gates the *glow* on `idleAlert` so
  the visual is unchanged.
- `ControlPaneInfo` (`src/main/control-server.ts` **and** `src/renderer/types.ts`): add
  `activity: 'busy' | 'idle' | 'exited'`.
- `buildControlPayload` (`src/renderer/control.ts`): per pane,
  `status==='exited' ? 'exited' : useIdle.getState().idle[p.id] ? 'idle' : 'busy'`.
- **Re-publish on idle flips:** the control-publish effect in `App.tsx` only subscribes to
  `useWorkspace`; add a `useIdle.subscribe(...)` that triggers the same debounced publish, or
  idle changes won't propagate.
- **Event:** add `{ type:'activity'; paneId; activity }` to `ControlEvent`; in
  `setWindowState`, diff incoming pane activity vs the prior snapshot and `broadcast` an
  `activity` event per flip (the coalesced `state` ping already fires too).
- MCP: `model.ts` `ControlPane` + `ControlEvent` add `activity`; `list_panes` /
  `control_status` surface it; `subscriptions.ts` may forward `activity` as a notification.

### C — `meta` map *(medium)*
- `PaneSpec` (renderer `types.ts`, main `workspace.ts`, `preload/index.ts`) + `Pane`
  (`types.ts`): add `meta?: Record<string,string>` (reserved keys: `role`, `parent`,
  `agentType`, `task`).
- `groupFromSpec` carry `meta`; `specFromGroup` emit `...(p.meta ? { meta: p.meta } : {})`.
- New store action `setPaneMeta(paneId, meta)` (shallow-merge) on `WorkspaceState`; `addPane`
  already takes `Partial<Pane>`, so spawn-time meta flows once `Pane` has the field.
- `ControlPaneInfo` + `buildControlPayload`: include `meta`.
- `applyControlCommand` (`control.ts`): `case 'setMeta'` → `ws.setPaneMeta(paneId, cmd.meta)`.
- MCP: `schema.ts` `PaneSpecSchema` add `meta: z.record(z.string()).optional()`;
  `control-tools.ts` add `meta` to `open_pane` + a `set_meta` tool; `model.ts` `ControlPane`
  add `meta`; `list_panes` surface it.

### D — open_pane returns the new paneId *(medium; the only non-trivial wiring)*
Turn `/command` into request/response:
- `ControlCommand` gains an optional `correlationId`. `ControlDeps.dispatchCommand` becomes
  `(windowId, cmd) => Promise<{ ok: boolean; result?: unknown }>`.
- `ipc.ts` `dispatchCommand`: mint a `correlationId`, keep a `Map<id, resolver>` with a ~2s
  timeout, `webContents.send('control:command', cmd)`, return the promise. Add an
  `ipcMain.on('control:commandResult', …)` that resolves it.
- `applyControlCommand` returns a value for result-bearing commands (`newPane` → the id from
  `ws.addPane(...)`, which already returns it); `App.tsx` `onCommand` replies via a new
  preload `control.commandResult(correlationId, result)` when `cmd.correlationId` is set.
- `control-server` `/command` handler `await`s `dispatchCommand` and returns
  `{ ok, result }`.
- MCP: `client.command` returns `{ ok, result }`; `open_pane` returns `{ ok, paneId: result }`
  (drop the "call list_panes" hint).

## Open questions / risks

- **Liveness is heuristic.** Output-quiescence ≈ "waiting", not a guaranteed "task complete".
  Agents that stream/think silently could read as idle; chatty ones never idle. May need a
  per-agentType tuning or an explicit "I'm done" convention workers can emit.
- **Terminal scraping is lossy** (ANSI/TUI redraws). Strip mode helps; structured messages
  are the durable fix but require MCP-capable workers.
- **Message delivery to dumb workers** degrades to `send_input` — no real inbox. Accept, or
  require orchestrated workers to be MCP-capable.
- **Scoped-token security:** tokens travel via pane env; a compromised worker leaks its
  (already limited) scope. Keep loopback-only + short TTL; never put the master token in a
  worker's env.
- **Who is root?** In (A) the human/MCP host. In (B) a designated CEO pane holds the master
  token — decide how it's granted (it shouldn't be a normal worker).
- **Backpressure:** a flooding worker vs the manager's context window — `tail`, sampling, or
  summarizer panes.
