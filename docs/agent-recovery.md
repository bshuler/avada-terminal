# Agent-Pane API-Error Recovery

Headless goal agents (spec agents, impl agents) run unattended for hours inside avada
panes. Two failure modes don't show up as a crash: the pane's Claude process hits an
`API Error:` and either auto-retries (fine, still alive) or goes idle forever; or a stray
tool-result record left over from a killed turn **poisons** the transcript so `--resume`
can never recover it through the documented path. Both leave the pane sitting there,
looking exactly like a slow but healthy agent. This doc is the contract for detecting and
recovering from both, implemented in `rs/crates/core/src/claude_recovery.rs`
(`detect_api_error`, `classify_api_error`, `resolve_session_candidates`,
`repair_transcript`) and exposed as the control command `recoverPane`.

## Why detection is output-based and conservative

The app's phase-5 supervisor (`control::supervisor`) is **exit-based**, and these deaths
never exit: the Claude process survives its API error and sits at the idle REPL prompt
forever, so exit supervision can't fire and no app-side auto-repair is wired this pass —
recovery is deliberately orchestrator-driven via `recoverPane`. If you came here assuming
the app notices these deaths on its own: it does not, by design; the watchdog does.

There is no structured signal for "this agent died mid-turn." The `SessionStart` hook that
stamps a pane's live-session marker only fires on a *new* session start — if the process
dies before its first turn completes, the marker is never written, so the one documented
recovery path (`restart_pane resume:true`) errors with "no live Claude marker" at exactly
the moment it's needed most. And an orchestrator watchdog that only tracks queue claims or
branch commits sees nothing either: an agent that dies before its first enqueue or first
commit produces **no** queue/branch signal, ever.

The one thing that's always present is the pane's own scrollback. So detection reads the
pane tail and looks for the **last** `API Error:` line — that's the only meaningful
"pane is not working" signal available, and it's read-only and idempotent to check.
Two things follow from that:

- **`retrying: true` means still alive — do not act.** Claude's own retry loop prints
  `API Error:` lines while it backs off and retries automatically. Treat this as *working*,
  not *wedged*; acting on it (restart/repair) races the process's own recovery and can
  compound the problem.
- Detection never guesses from silence alone. A quiet pane mid-compile or mid-tool-call is
  not distinguishable from a dead one by timer; the tail is what disambiguates.

## Session resolution: marker, then scan

To resume or repair a transcript you need its `sessionId` and the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` it
belongs to (accounts each have their own `projects` store, and resuming under the wrong
account fails). Resolution tries, in order:

1. **Marker** — the pane's live-session marker, if `SessionStart` wrote one. Fast path,
   exact match, `source:"marker"`.
2. **Scan** — if there's no marker (the death-before-first-turn gap above), fall back to
   scanning **every** per-account `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/<encoded-cwd>/` store for
   transcripts matching the pane's cwd, across all accounts in rotation — not just the
   pane's current `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, since the pane may have started under a different
   account than it's running under now. `source:"scan"` returns `candidates`, newest
   `mtimeMs` first (recency is the only ordering signal available; there's no other way to
   guess which transcript the dead process was writing to).
3. **Explicit override** — an operator-supplied `sessionId` wins over both when given.

**Encoded-cwd rule:** Claude encodes a project's working directory into its store path by
keeping `[A-Za-z0-9]` and replacing every other character with `-`. Scanning must reproduce
this exactly (not a fuzzy match) to land in the right per-account directory.

**Why every candidate carries `configDir`:** a `sessionId` alone is not enough to resume —
`claude --resume <id>` reads from whatever `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set in the environment it's
launched with, and the same cwd can have transcripts under more than one account. Without
`configDir` traveling with the candidate, a caller could resume the right session under the
wrong account and get a fresh 401/empty-history instead of the real transcript.

## Repair: surgical, byte-preserving, idempotent

A poisoned transcript is a JSONL file where a tool-call record's matching tool-result was
never written (the process died between the call and the result — often triggered by a
tool the harness can't answer, e.g. a first-turn `ToolSearch` call that never resolves).
`--resume` on a transcript like that fails deterministically, every time, forever — it's
not a race, so retrying without repairing just reproduces the same failure.

Repair is deliberately narrow:

- **Surgical** — it drops *only* the orphaned tool-call/tool-result record(s); every other
  line is untouched.
- **Byte-preserving** — lines that are kept are copied verbatim, not re-serialized. This
  avoids incidental reformatting (key order, whitespace, float formatting) turning into a
  diff noise or a subtly different transcript than the one Claude wrote.
- **Idempotent** — running repair on an already-healthy transcript is a no-op (`dropped: []`,
  no backup written). Running it twice on the same poisoned transcript is safe: the second
  run finds nothing left to drop.
- **Backed up first** — before any mutation, the original is copied to a timestamped `.bak`
  path alongside it. Repair never overwrites without a recovery copy behind it.

See `rs/crates/core/tests/fixtures/g2-poisoned-transcript.jsonl` for a worked example: a
33-line transcript where the orphaned tool-result record sits at line index **9** (0-based)
— an unanswered tool-call with no matching result before the transcript ends.

## The `recoverPane` control command

```
POST /command
{
  "type": "recoverPane",
  "paneId": "<id>",
  "action": "inspect" | "repair" | "resume",
  "sessionId"?: "<uuid override>",
  "force"?: bool
}
```

### `action: "inspect"` (read-only)

```json
{
  "activity": "...",
  "apiError": { "code": "...", "detail": "...", "retrying": true } ,
  "class": "transient" | "account-limit" | "poisoned" | "unknown" | null,
  "session": { "source": "marker", "sessionId": "...", "configDir": "...", "cwd": "..." }
}
```

or, when there's no marker:

```json
{ "session": { "candidates": [ { "sessionId": "...", "configDir": "...", "path": "...", "mtimeMs": 0 } ] } }
```

`apiError` is `null` when the last meaningful pane activity wasn't an API error. Always
inspect before acting — never repair or resume on a guess.

### `action: "repair"`

Resolves the transcript (marker session, else the newest same-cwd candidate across all
per-account stores, else an explicit `sessionId` override), and if `class == "poisoned"`
(or `force: true`), writes the `.bak` and excises only the orphaned record(s):

```json
{ "sessionId": "...", "path": "...", "dropped": [9], "backup": "<path>.bak" }
```

A healthy transcript returns `dropped: []` and `backup: null` — repair is safe to call
speculatively.

### `action: "resume"`

Restarts the pane with the resolved (and, if needed, just-repaired) session — the
`restart_pane`-with-resume path, so the conversation comes back intact. **Never call
`resume` on a `poisoned` transcript without repairing it first** — resuming a poisoned
transcript directly reproduces the exact same wedge. For `account-limit`, rotate
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a different, non-exhausted account *before* resuming (same account
just re-hits the same limit); for `transient`, resume under the same account.

### Class policy

| `class`         | Meaning                                              | Action                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `transient`     | Retryable API blip, process is otherwise fine          | `resume`, same account                    |
| `account-limit` | Rate/weekly limit hit on this account                  | rotate `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, then `resume` |
| `poisoned`      | Orphaned tool-result record wedges `--resume` forever  | `repair`, then `resume` — never resume raw |
| `unknown`       | Doesn't match a known pattern                          | escalate to the human/orchestrator — never thrash restarts |

## Watchdog guidance (orchestrator & spec agent)

`resources/claude/goal-orchestrator/SKILL.md` and `SPEC.md` both carry a watchdog addition
built on this contract: watch pane **activity and API-error state**, not only queue/branch
movement — an agent that dies before its first enqueue or commit is invisible to queue and
branch signals alike, and the tail's `API Error:` line is the only tell. Both personas also
warn every spawned agent off calling `ToolSearch`/deferred tool loading — a first-turn
`ToolSearch` call is exactly the kind of unanswered tool call that produces the
poisoned-transcript pattern this document describes.

Two field-tested refinements (both from the incident that motivated this doc):

- **Idleness alone is not a wedge.** A spec agent that finished its turn and is waiting on
  its own fan-out is healthy and reads as idle — the first orchestrator watchdog pass
  false-positived on exactly this. An `API Error:` line in the tail fires immediately; bare
  idleness only counts as death when **no task is claimed across the goal's queues AND no
  worker process is alive** for it. A live child shell or a spinner in the tail means
  *working*, not wedged.
- **A vanished pane id is not a wedged agent.** A worker pane can drop out of the read
  model while its process and its `--log-dir` log stay healthy (observed live; tracked
  separately as its own goal). When a pane id stops resolving, fall back to the queue's
  task states and the worker log before declaring the agent dead — `recoverPane` on an
  unresolvable pane id errors, it does not classify.

Endpoint recipes go stale and a stale recipe wedges an agent as effectively as an API
error (this goal's briefing shipped one). The authoritative control-API surface is
`rs/crates/core/src/control/routes.rs` — check it there rather than trusting a persona's
inlined `curl` line.

## Named failure mode: control-plane hijack by a dev/test instance

`app.rs:44-46`: `AVADA_CONTROL_FILE` takes **precedence** over the XDG-derived
control-file path. Every agent pane inherits that variable pointing at the LIVE
`~/.local/state/avada/control.json` — so a dev build booted from a pane with only
`XDG_STATE_HOME` overridden still writes its port+token over the live file, silently
repointing every agent (and the orchestrator's MCP bridge) at a dead instance. This
happened three times in one session while building this very feature. Two rules follow:

- Any dev/test boot of a avada binary must override `AVADA_CONTROL_FILE`
  **on the command line itself** (not in prose, not via XDG alone) and assert afterwards
  that the live control.json is byte-identical to a pre-run snapshot —
  `scripts/g3-recovery-demo.sh` is the reference implementation.
- A watchdog seeing sudden `unauthorized` or `"no such pane"` for panes that were just
  alive must **re-read control.json** before concluding anything died: the symptoms of a
  hijacked control file lie about their cause.
