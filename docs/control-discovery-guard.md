# Control-file ownership guard (`control.json`)

## The failure mode this closes

`core/src/app.rs:44-46` resolves the discovery file as `AVADA_CONTROL_FILE` with
precedence over the XDG-derived default (`~/.local/state/avada/control.json`).
Every spawned pane **inherits** that variable pointing at the LIVE file
(`session::spawn`), so a dev/test build launched from an agent pane — even one that
overrides `XDG_STATE_HOME` — still targets the live `control.json`. On start it
overwrote the live instance's port + token, and every agent reading the file began
failing with `fetch failed` / `unauthorized` / `no such pane`: symptoms that look like
a crashed agent or a pane-vanish race, with nothing pointing at the hijacked file
(tell-tale in the clobbered file: `"version": "0.0.0"`, the dev-build version, where a
release records the real one). `docs/agent-recovery.md` § "Named failure mode:
control-plane hijack by a dev/test instance" documents the recovery playbook; this
guard is the prevention.

The existing `single_instance` gate cannot catch this: it is deliberately
flavor-salted (`-headless`, see `core/src/app.rs`) so the GUI app and a headless
daemon never collide there — correct for argv hand-off, blind to file ownership.

## The guard (`core/src/control/discovery_guard.rs`)

Before `run_server` claims the file it reads it and checks the recorded pid. The file
is refused ONLY when that pid is alive, is not ours, and **verifiably looks like an
Avada process** (comm/argv0 on Linux, `ps` comm elsewhere on unix, image path on
Windows — matching `avada` or the `headless` bin). Everything else claims
cleanly; the guard **fails open**, because a wrongly-refused legitimate launch would
be a worse wedge than the clobber it prevents:

- **live foreign Avada pid → refuse startup**, before binding anything, with a
  message naming the live owner (pid / port / version), the copy-pasteable isolation
  env line, and the pid-reuse escape hatch. The refusal is retried for ~5s first, so
  an owner that is mid-exit (restart overlap) is claimed instead of refused. The
  headless daemon exits 1 with the message; the GUI host's detached server task also
  logs it to stderr.
- **pid dead (zombies count as dead), file missing/corrupt, or pid is ours**
  (in-process `ControlHost` restart) **→ claim cleanly.** Crash recovery needs no
  manual cleanup.
- **pid alive but some unrelated program (recycled pid), or identity unreadable →
  claim.** A reused pid can never brick startup forever.
- `remove_discovery` is owner-checked the same way: an instance only deletes a file
  recording its own pid, so a refused instance quitting cannot delete the live owner's
  file either.

`restartApp` (both scopes) is safe twice over: same-flavor restarts are serialized by
the `single_instance` flock (released only when the old process dies) plus the
relauncher's 2s sleep (`app::service_restart_request`), and the guard's retry window
covers any residual overlap. Exactly two code paths ever write discovery — the GUI's
`ControlHost` and the core headless `app::run` (`grep -rn "server::run_server"
rs/crates`); the session daemon (`--session-daemon`) and `avada worker` are
clients only, so no legitimate pair of processes can deadlock on the guard.

Known limit: two instances starting simultaneously against a not-yet-written file
both pass (last write wins) — the incident class is a dev build joining a long-lived
live instance, where the file always exists first.

## Running an isolated dev instance (the supported way)

```sh
d=$(mktemp -d -p ~/.cache)   # not /tmp: tmpfs
XDG_STATE_HOME=$d AVADA_CONTROL_FILE=$d/control.json \
  cargo run --bin headless
```

Both variables matter: `XDG_STATE_HOME` isolates the rest of the state dir, and
`AVADA_CONTROL_FILE` must be set explicitly because the inherited value would
otherwise win (that precedence is the whole failure mode). Optionally add
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$d` too: `control-settings.json` lives in the config dir, so a dev
instance otherwise inherits the live bind address — harmless (the live port is taken
and it falls back to loopback), just noisy. An unisolated dev launch
now fails fast with the refusal message instead of hijacking the live control plane.
