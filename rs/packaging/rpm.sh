# Contract (mirrors appimage.sh):
#   rs/packaging/rpm.sh <version>     # <version> WITHOUT a leading "v"
#   → rs/packaging/out/avada-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm
# Runs from any cwd; exits non-zero on any failure; artifact under rs/packaging/out/.
#
# Layout (FHS): /usr/bin/avada + /usr/share/avada/resources/shell-integration/…
# (the assets list lives in crates/app/Cargo.toml [package.metadata.generate-rpm]). No root and
# no rpm-build tooling needed — cargo-generate-rpm is a pure-Rust cargo plugin that writes the
# rpm header + cpio payload directly; installed on demand if absent.
