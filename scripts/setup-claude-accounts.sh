#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup-claude-accounts.sh — prepare multiple Claude accounts for avada goal-orchestrator
# account rotation, WITHOUT breaking `claude --resume` across accounts.
#
# WHY: the `claude` CLI stores conversation transcripts under $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
# (…/projects/<cwd-hash>/<sessionId>.jsonl, plus …/sessions/). So a session created under
# one account is invisible to `--resume` when a pane runs a different CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR.
# Goal-orchestrator rotates accounts per-pane and needs resume to keep working across a
# rotation — so transcripts must live in ONE shared store while credentials stay per-account.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (per account dir): move its projects/ + sessions/ into ~/.claude-shared,
# then replace them with symlinks back to the shared store. Credentials (.credentials.json)
# and everything else stay per-account. Result:
#
#   ~/.claude-shared/{projects,sessions}          # single real transcript store
#   ~/.claude       creds A ; projects,sessions -> shared
#   ~/.claude-alt   creds B ; projects,sessions -> shared
#   ~/.claude-alt2  creds C ; projects,sessions -> shared   (created empty; log in separately)
#
# SAFETY: dry-run by default (prints what it WOULD do). Pass --apply to execute. Every moved
# dir is backed up first. Idempotent: a dir already symlinked to the shared store is skipped.
# It NEVER deletes a real transcript — on merge collisions the existing shared copy wins and
# the incoming file is left in the backup.
