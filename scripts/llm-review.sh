# scripts/llm-review.sh — the LLM-judge step for the unattended auto-merge pipeline.
#
# Runs the review through CLAUDE CODE (the `claude` CLI in headless `-p` mode), so the
# judgment is billed against the Claude Code SUBSCRIPTION — NOT the metered Anthropic API.
# There is no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY here and none is wanted.
#
# RUNTIME REQUIREMENT: this must run where `claude` is installed AND already logged in —
# i.e. a SELF-HOSTED runner on a machine with an authenticated Claude Code (or the local
# avada worker-pool pipeline). A cloud GitHub-hosted runner has no Claude Code session,
# so `claude` will be missing or unauthenticated and the gate FAILS CLOSED (blocks the merge).
#
# CONTRACT (this is real and the workflow depends on it — do not change the shape):
#   inputs (env, with defaults):
#     LLM_REVIEW_DIFF    path to the (capped) unified diff          [default: diff.patch]
#     LLM_REVIEW_META    path to JSON {title, body}                 [default: meta.json]
#     LLM_REVIEW_OUT     path to write the verdict JSON             [default: verdict.json]
#     LLM_REVIEW_MODEL   claude model alias (opus|sonnet|haiku|...) [optional; default = the
#                        runner's configured default model]
#     LLM_REVIEW_TIMEOUT seconds before the judge is killed         [default: 240]
#   output (LLM_REVIEW_OUT), exactly:
#     { "verdict": "approve" | "block", "risk": <int 0-10>, "summary": "<terse text>" }
#   exit code:
#     0 on a *successfully produced* verdict (approve OR block — the workflow gates on the
#       verdict field, so a "block" verdict is still a successful run).
#     non-zero ONLY on an internal failure to produce a verdict. To keep the gate fail-closed
#       without ever surfacing a non-verdict (a missing `claude`, a timeout, unparseable
#       output) as an "approve", those cases write a BLOCK verdict and exit 0.
#
# The rubric below is the actual gate policy. Bias toward BLOCK when uncertain — a human will
# pick it up. The judge reads the diff as DATA; it never executes PR code.

You are a strict release gatekeeper for an unattended merge pipeline.
APPROVE only if ALL of the following hold; otherwise BLOCK:
  1. The change plausibly accomplishes its stated title/issue.
  2. No tests deleted/skipped/weakened to make CI pass; no assertions gutted.
  3. No secrets committed, no obvious backdoor, no telemetry/exfiltration added.
  4. No weakening of security-critical code (auth, token minting/validation, the control
     server, signature/permission checks).
  5. Error handling is not silently swallowed; no panics introduced on the happy path.
  6. Scope matches the PR title (no unrelated drive-by edits).
Bias toward BLOCK when uncertain — a human will pick it up. Be terse.
Return ONLY a single JSON object and nothing else: {"verdict":"approve|block","risk":0-10,"summary":"..."}
